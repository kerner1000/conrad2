the interface, main {@link calhoun.analysis.crf.Conrad} class, and solver for the Conrad engine.  The Conrad class is the main entry point for the engine, either 
as an executable through it's <code>main</code> method or programmatically through it's public interface.  Very little goes on
in the Conrad class, all real functionality is delegated out to the various beans which are configured in the model.  This includes
the model itself, I/O handling, and even the training and inference algorithms.  This component approach allows Conrad to be very 
easily configured for different problems and approaches.
<p>
The main things to understand in this class as the various FeatureManager interfaces if you plan to implement your own features, and the 
various CRF... interfaces if you plan to reconfigure the engine or solver.
